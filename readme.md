## by Zyad Alatar

## intoduction:

    This project consists of two parts. In the first part, you will have an exploratory data analysis on a dataset Ford GoBike System Data.The     analysis in this part will be structured and using simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships.
## Dataset:

    This dataset is about ford GoBike System.This dataset contains many attributes such as gender of user and duration of the trip and type of     user and also other spatial data.

## Summary of Findings:

    after investigating the dataset I come up with :
    1)There are more subscribers than customers.
    2)In the range between 500 to 1500 meters a lot of people travel compared to other distance.
    3)There are more Males than any other gender.
    4)Trip Duration is so dependendable on the age of the member, when the age between 20 to 45, the trip duration is higher than the older         ages.


## Key Insights for Presentation:

    1)Distribution of Gender,it was  clear that there is huge difference between Male users to Female, Males are more with around 130000 users       where females are less than 40000.
    2)Distance occurence,it is clear that there is huge difference between Subscriber users to Customer, Subscriber are more with around a  a       160000 users where Customer are lower than 20000.
    3)Duration distribution:We can say that most of the trips are between 1 second to 1000 seconds to make more understandable most trips are      from 1 second to 16 minutes that gives an many indicators such as there should be a discount for longer duration.
